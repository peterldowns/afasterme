Today I learned about the existence of LESS, which is a type of CSS
pre-processor. LESS, like all pre-proecessors, is a tool for writing code more
effectively and efficiently. I learned its syntax and its usage.

#####Reason for Importance

LESS is important because it allows me to write, well, _less_ code and still
achieve the same result. I'm working on an entire website all by myself, and I
have something like two and a half weeks to complete it. If I ever want to get
it working well enough to demo (and pass Senior Project), I'll need to be as
efficient as possible and really get work done quickly. LESS allows me to style
the website — make it look pretty and useable — faster than I would be able to
without it. Also, it makes the website much more maintainable in the future,
should I decide to keep working on it.

I did a lot of research on "schema" design for the MongoDB NoSQL database.
Because it's NoSQL, I don't have to think as carefully about the design
(because I can change it later), but it's good to have a plan.

#####Reason for Importance

Modern web apps *all* depend on databases. They are used to keep track of
users' data, their sessions, and all sorts of metrics. By learning a lot about
how to use the database, I'm learning an invaluable skill that will help me for
the rest of my life, especially as the world becomes more and more dominated by
internet technologies and data mining. It's also important that I understand
how to use this database because it's how I plan on storing data for my website
— every user has a training schedule that needs to be kept track of.

The new skill I learned today was how to create a REST-ful API (Application
Programming Interface). I used the [Parse](https://www.parse.com/docs/rest) API
as a reference and did other research to determine the best way to expose the
workings of my application.

#####Reason for Importance

API design is one of the hardest problems in computer science. A well-designed
API allows quick iteration improvement to the program/website's functionality,
while working with a poor API feels like actively fighting your code to get
anything done. I've learned a lot about good API design (Parse's API is often
pointed to as an example of how to design one) and come up with a plan for how
to apply those to my site. This will make future development faster, and any
code that's written easier to maintain. What's more, the design I've come up
with will let me interact with my users' data in many different ways, so I'm
not restricted to just one possible way of creating my website.

#####Person / Event / Skill

I figured out how to work with MongoDB from within
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), the programming language I'm using to develop
this website (which still doesn't have a name). With this knowledge, I wrote
code describing a general "Database Connection" and its associated functions
(save, find, delete, update).

#####Reason for Importance

This is huge. I cannot emphasize that enough. Node.js is an
asynchronously-focused language. That is, you may say to it "Do Task A, and when
that's done do Tasks B and C." While that may sound similar to most programming
languages, Node is different because if you say "Do Task A, then Task B, then
Task C, and print their results" the results could be printed in *any* order.
You must structure your code as a series of "callbacks" — tasks to immediately
after another task has finished. This *is* dramatically different than other
languages that I've used like C or Python, so it's been very difficult to wrap
my head around. That being said, it's an important and popular way of writing
code, so for the sake of advancing my programming knowledge it's a good thing I
now sort of understand it. Also, there's no way I could write this website
without talking to the database, so it's really important (and awesome) that I
have this working now.
