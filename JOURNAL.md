#####Person / Event / Skill

Today I learned about the existence of LESS, which is a type of CSS
pre-processor. LESS, like all pre-proecessors, is a tool for writing code more
effectively and efficiently. I learned its syntax and its usage.

#####Reason for Importance

LESS is important because it allows me to write, well, _less_ code and still
achieve the same result. I'm working on an entire website all by myself, and I
have something like two and a half weeks to complete it. If I ever want to get
it working well enough to demo (and pass Senior Project), I'll need to be as
efficient as possible and really get work done quickly. LESS allows me to style
the website — make it look pretty and useable — faster than I would be able to
without it. Also, it makes the website much more maintainable in the future,
should I decide to keep working on it.

I did a lot of research on "schema" design for the MongoDB NoSQL database.
Because it's NoSQL, I don't have to think as carefully about the design (because
I can change it later), but it's good to have a plan.

#####Reason for Importance

Modern web apps *all* depend on databases. They are used to keep track of users'
data, their sessions, and all sorts of metrics. By learning a lot about how to
use the database, I'm learning an invaluable skill that will help me for the
rest of my life, especially as the world becomes more and more dominated by
internet technologies and data mining. It's also important that I understand how
to use this database because it's how I plan on storing data for my website
— every user has a training schedule that needs to be kept track of.
